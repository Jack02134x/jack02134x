## 🚀 Who Am I?

A **Linux-first computer science student** who prefers terminals over GUIs and learning by **building, breaking, and fixing**.

I enjoy working close to the system layer: scripting, automation, configuration, and tooling. I explore game engines for fun, AI out of curiosity, and software engineering because things should not fall apart when you touch them.

Currently focused on **strong fundamentals**, **clean code**, and **projects that actually do something**.
