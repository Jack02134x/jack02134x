## About Me

I am a computer science student who learns primarily through **hands-on experimentation and building things**. My interests span **software engineering, Linux systems, game development, and artificial intelligence**, and I enjoy understanding how tools work under the hood rather than just using them.

I am comfortable working in **Linux-first environments**, writing scripts to automate tasks, managing configurations, and building small utilities that solve real problems. I enjoy learning new technologies incrementally and prefer practical understanding over memorization.

Currently, I am focused on improving my core programming fundamentals, building system-level projects, exploring game engines, and gradually moving toward AI-related work.

I am open to **internships, open-source collaboration, and learning-focused opportunities**.

## Philosophy (Short and Honest)

I learn best by building, breaking, and fixing things.  
I value clarity over buzzwords and fundamentals over hype.
